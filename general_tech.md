# Game Settings

## Custom Keybinding
Execution can be made easier by customizing key mappings in Options > Controls

Personally, I use these custom keybindings:
* Execute shadow mode = R key
* Use mode (interact/pick up) = CAPSLOCK
* Rotate camera = Q & E keys


## Custom Difficulty
For categories without difficulty restrictions, Beginner difficulty generally allows for the fastest strats. However, customizing certain factors to "harder" settings can be even faster.
 
Select Beginner difficulty, then customize the following based on the level:
* Showdown time pause: Time pause can make execution easier, but time pause off can allow other actions/events to progress while you're in showdown mode. It also affects how fast-forward works.
* Detection speed: Slow detection helps avoid undesired alerts, while fast detection can be used to trigger strategic alerts faster.



# General Tech

## Fast Forward
Fast forward (FF) makes everything move faster, so you'll want to have fast forward turned on as much as you can manage in categories where it's allowed.

## Camera Movement
* Double press your character's number key (1: Cooper, 2: McCoy, etc) to slide the camera to their location
* Increase camera speed in the settings


## Cutscene Progression
Enemies always start in the same spots when a level is loaded, and most enemies will progress along their routes as cutscenes play. When using in-game time, let cutscenes play until enemies are at the best positioning for you. 


## Strategic Alarm
You can manipulate enemies by causing a well-planned alarm. Enemies detecting you or a dead body (nearby) will alert and move toward the offending stimulus. Other nearby enemies will also be distracted by this.

Unlike Desperados III, alarms don't prevent you from completing most objectives, except for ones that are followed by mid-level cutscenes.


# Strategic Suspicion
Like with alarms, you can manipulate enemies by making them suspicious (yellow question mark), with them moving to investigate footprints, loud footsteps, or a body (a ways away). This can be a great way to pull an individual enemy out of a crowded area.


## Drop Kill
(To test) KO'd characters will die if they are dropped off a ledge and land 2 or more stories lower.

# Character Abilities

## Action Speed
Different characters have different speeds for equivalent actions. When you have options, choose the fastest character for the task.
